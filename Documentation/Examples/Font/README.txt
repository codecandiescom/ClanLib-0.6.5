      Summary: Two font methods

Shows hows to load two fonts, generated in different ways. One font uses the
"old" method, where the font characters are split into boxes. The other font
uses the new method of alpha-transparency to automatically detect characters.
The new method also gives you alpha-blended fonts.

For more information about font creation take a look at the section on fonts
in the overview: ClanLib/Documentation/Overview/
or on the net at http://www.clanlib.org
