      Summary: Make your own surface provider

Example of writing a surface provider. This examples surface provider
generates the image data instead of loading it from a file like the surface
providers in ClanLib (tga, jpg, png...) do. You should see a fade from/to of
several colors (sort of gradient fill) in the example window.
