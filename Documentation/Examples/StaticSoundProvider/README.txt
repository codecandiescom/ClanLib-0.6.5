      Summary: Example of writing your own static soundprovider.

This example shows how to write your own static soundprovider. In this case Static
means non-streamed...  A static sound provider loads the whole sample before
playing while a streamed provider loads the sample data while playing.

This sample will generate a single "sine tone" for you to hear.
