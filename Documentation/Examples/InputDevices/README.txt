      Summary: Joystick , keyboard, input abstraction

The example shows how the physical buttons can be abstracted into logical
buttons used by the game.

For instance, the fire_button is the game's logical fire button. But
physically it is serveral buttons on the keyboards and the joystick. 


You should see a window with a blue background. There is red rectangle 
in the middle of the window that you can move around (cursor or joystick).
press fire/space/esc to exit
