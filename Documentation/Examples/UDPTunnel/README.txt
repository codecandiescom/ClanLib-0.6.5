      Summary: UDP Tunnel, sockets, no ClanApp, console application

This program demonstrates how to use the CL_Socket and CL_IPAddress classes.
It also shows how you can just use the network module of ClanLib, without
using clanApp.

It is also excellent to send UDP packets via a third host when playing UT.
