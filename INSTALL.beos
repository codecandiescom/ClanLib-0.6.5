This is a PRELIMINARY port of ClanLib to BeOS. It doesn't work yet.
Start working on the TODO list below, and when that is empty,
the port might start to work.

REQUIREMENTS:
- BeOS develop tools
- autoconf
- Hermes
- Perl (not really neccessary unless building documentation)

TODO:
- Fix mutex_beos and thread_beos
- Fix sound
- Fix network
- The ClanLib libs get REALLY REALLY big in debugmode.. find out why and fix.

Enjoy,
The ClanLib Development Team
