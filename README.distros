Hello distribution maker,

If you happen to make any patches to these sources and think they should be
incorporated in our next release, don't hestitate to let us know.. we would
gladly apply any patches that improve ClanLib.

note that there are several rpm specs in Setup/Unix/ 
(for the different distributions)

best regards,

	The ClanLib Team
