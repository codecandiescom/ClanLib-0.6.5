Due to the modest volume of patches we get on the mailing list and
because all recent patches that have come in are rather hairy, I am
writing up a summary of how to create patches for the mailing list.

Diffing
===================================
Use 'diff -u' or 'cvs diff -u' from within the Libs/ClanLib-0.6 directory. 
This is contextual diff, it provides more information so it easier to
examine the changes before applying.

If you're using Windows, you might want to download the small utility
at http://clanlib.org/development/winpatch.html.
Do your changes in a copy of the ClanLib directory (so you have one
copy with the original sourcefiles, and one with your changes).
Run the winpatch utility, fill in the paths to the two directories,
and it generates a patch (list of changes you did to files).

Submitting
===================================
Patches should be compressed (not everybody in on cable or DSL)
Prefered formats are: Gzip, Zip.

Please submit patches to our mailing-list (either devel or user).
clanlib-devel@dark.x.dtu.dk, or clanlib-user@dark.x.dtu.dk.

Describing
===================================
You should describe what your patch does.  Please no 'This fixes a bug'.
Tell us which bug, in what component. Generally, be descriptive without
being needless verbose.
